# fsharp-merge-sort
Simple merge sort functional program for lists

###How to compile it?
Paste the code and run it in [Visual Studio's F# Interactive](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233175.aspx) or [SublimeText's REPL](https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL)
###How to run it?
I put an example in the code's comments, it works the following way:


merge sort following list: (2, 9, 3, 1, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6)

> mergesort [2;9;3;1;4;5;8;7;6];;
val it : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9]
